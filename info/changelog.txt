   *** Version History ***   V-0.1.0: Unofficial ReleaseReleased: 04/16/2016**Libraries**GCore V-0.2.1  --  Added basic neuron and neuron layer support for neural networks.    --  Added the forward propagation neural network for using basic neural networks.    V-0.1.1: Activation Function UpdateReleased: 04/17/2016**Libraries**GCore V-0.2.1  --  Added activation functions to the neural networks so you can specify how the data is      transfered from neuron to neuron.        --  Activation functions can be different for each neuron / neuron layer so that customized      outputs and inputs can be used.        --  Added the default activation functions of sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent.    V-0.1.2: Neural Network Saving UpdateReleased: 04/19/2016**Libraries**GCore V-0.2.1GFiles V-0.1.5  --  Added the ability to load and save neural networks to files using the neural network file class.      This class extends a virtual file so all of the methods from that class can be used in this, the      format is a csv file so the underlying csv file is also available.        --  This update added the ability to make a csv file text string from a neural network, do not use this      ability as it will be removed from public view soon, at this point it is not entirely clear how to      do so.          V-0.1.3: Activation Function Saving UpdateReleased: 04/21/2016**Libraries**GCore V-0.2.1GFiles V-0.1.5  --  Added the ability of saving what activation function the neural network is using so the correct one is used      by the generated neural network.        --  Changed the way the activation function is set up, so it can be changed later if you are using a custom not      supported activation function.            V-0.1.4: Genetic Neural Network UpdateReleased: 04/23/2016**Libraries**GCore V-0.2.1GFiles V-0.1.5GGenetic V-0.1.1  --  Added the abstract neural network class so that neural networks don't need to implement all of their      functionality, and can rely on a underlying class to get it right.        --  Added a genetic neural network class that acts as more of a net and allows the creature to determine      not only how many neurons there are but the structure of the network as well.        --  Added the respective neural gene and neural creature classes to create creatures that use the genes      of the genetic neural network class.            V-0.1.5: Backpropagation UpdateReleased: 05/04/2016**Libraries**GCore V-0.2.1GFiles V-0.1.5GGenetic V-0.1.1  --  Added the ability to use backpropagation to train a neural network for a known data set. Currently      you can only do one data point at a time.        --  Fixed a bug where the network saved wasn't updated after the weights of a neural network had been      changed, this will now allow for the network to be saved after trained and allow for the training      to pick up again where it left off.            V-0.1.6: File Writing Optimization UpdateReleased: 05/06/2016**Libraries**GCore V-0.2.1GFiles V-0.1.6GGenetic V-0.1.1  --  Fixed the to csv string as not to take as much memory when converting large neural networks to a string      that can be saved to the file system. This is done by using the string buffer class.        --  Further optimizations were made by using the new byte array constructor for the underlying virtual file      when creating a neural network file.
